    <p>Hi everyone;hello world! My name is Bridger Fronk and I am from Vero Beach, Florida. 
        I have always had a love for technology and have been interested in the way that it works.
        I have been a member of the church my whole life. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development via the pathway degree program.
        I like to play video games and a recent hobby that I have gotten into is cubing.
        I know how to solve both the 3X3 and 4X4 and my best time on the 3X3 is a minute and 24 seconds which is isn't very fast
        (my little brother has a 1:03.22, (granted that kid is a whiz and his interest to career in engineering is inspired by none  other than Mark Rober haha).
        As for a favorite speaker I think I share the sentiment that Jeffery R. Holland is very close to the top of my list. 
        Not only is he funny, but I love his optimism and sense of hope, which is akin to president Nelson. 
        I am looking forward to learning and growing with all of you and good luck in the course until we collaborate again!!</p>
