        to and is eager to capture their most precious memories in a beautiful and meaningful 
        way. When they get to the site, they will be greeted with a lovely picture and 
        introduction of the photographer, my grandma, after that, they will see a few examples of her work, 
        and have the option to explore more rich content and edits, as well as look at pricing, so they can 
        get a general idea of the cost and the affordability. From there off from the homepage, there will be

        about me and contact me pages. Direct ease of access to book an appointment and immediately be on my grandma’s radar through a message will be a priority 
        for the site. The site will also have a link to my grandma's Facebook so that the clients can get to know 
        her on a more personal level. This will help engagement on the site and in her business.

        Apart from just looking beautiful, it will have an ease of use that the clients will appreciate. 
        Growing interaction between my grandma’s Facebook, updated website, and happy clients is what’s going to 
        give the site longevity in the market and keep people coming back for more. Word will spread and engagement 
        will be high and the website is a key part of that and how it all begins 
        There will definitely also have to be a page where sample content is shown along with pricing for the different types of sessions.
